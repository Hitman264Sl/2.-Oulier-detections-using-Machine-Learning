✅ Objective: Identify anomalies in datasets using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

✅ Data Collection: Gather structured data from real-world sources like financial transactions, sensor data, or healthcare records

✅ Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical data

✅ Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features for improved anomaly detection accuracy

✅ Model Implementation: Train and evaluate Isolation Forest and LOF to detect deviations from normal patterns

✅ Performance Evaluation: Use precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness

✅ Deployment: Integrate the model into a system for real-time anomaly detection


This project enhances skills in data preprocessing, unsupervised learning, and model optimization, making it applicable in fraud detection, cybersecurity, and predictive maintenance.
